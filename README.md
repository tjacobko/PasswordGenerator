# PasswordGenerator
Never use an insecure password again.

## What it does
Password Generator creates two random 15-character passwords that may consist of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.

## How it works
When launched, click the button **Generate passwords**, and the two bottom buttons will have your randomly generated passwords in which you can click to copy to your
clipboard. Click the **Generate passwords** button as many times as you'd like till you find a password that fits you.
